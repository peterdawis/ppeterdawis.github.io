                <p>In our rapidly evolving digital age, the ability to navigate and understand
                    the world of
                    technology has become increasingly essential. My IT-related subject helps me understand the
                    basic fundamentals of programming; it gives me ideas on how interesting programming is and how
                    programming can
                    change the world. My favorite lesson, based on my experience, is learning programming. It
                    challenges my
                    thinking skills and my creativity. It allows me to explore innovative solutions and develop
                    applications
                    that can positively impact various industries, such as healthcare, finance, and
                    entertainment.
                    During my learning, the lesson that challenged me the most was understanding very complex
                    programs and
                    writing them into code, but after finishing the given activity, it was very satisfying.

                    complex structures, with errors becoming daily puzzles. Yet, with each hurdle, code unveiled its
                    logic, transforming a blank page into a website. The challenges were real, but the reward of
                    creation made it all worthwhile.

                    HTML is challenging. I experience a lot of errors on the code which leads to
                    unexpected results or even break the layout. The part that I did well was crafting
                    responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes. In achieving my goal, I use the
                    trial-and-error method means the process of determining the best method to achieve
                    the desired outcome by recognizing and removing errors or failures through various
                    experimental techniques is known as trial and error</p>

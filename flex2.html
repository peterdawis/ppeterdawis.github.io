                    <h2>Howell Griff M. Pimentel</h2>

                <p>My Gaming Career and achivements..
                    Howell, a Genshin Impact player from the Philippines, is currently enjoying the new character, Furina. They
                    are also looking forward to the release of Columbina, the 3rd Harbinger, codenamed The Damselette in the
                    Fatui. Howell has cleared Spiral Abyss 12-3 and boasts a collection of powerful characters, including Venti,
                    Zhongli, Raiden Shogun, Nahida, Furina, Cyno, Ayaka, and Shenhe, each with their signature weapon. Having
                    played the game since its release in 2020, Howell's dedication is evident. He even went so far as to create a
                    second account featuring a Constellation 6 Raiden, requiring an estimated investment of 70,000 PHP in wishes
                    and other premium characters and their signature weapons. This achievement is a testament to his passion for
                    the game, as he has invested both significant time and resources into his playing experience. Howell's
                    dedication is truly commendable and serves as an inspiration to other players.

                    My achievements display my hard work and ethical work in achieving them. They make me acknowledge how far I
                    have come from where I started to where I am in my life. Without these achievements, I would feel like my life
                    would be incomplete, serving no purpose. These achievements of mine give me a reason of feeling like a human.

                <p>My first python program......
                    During the making of this program, I was so confused because I was not so familiar with this language.
          
                    However, I persevered and sought help from online resources and experienced programmers. Gradually, my
                    understanding of the language improved, enabling me to overcome the initial confusion and successfully
                    complete the program.

                <p>My Graduation In Senior high
                    Graduation was a proud and joyful moment for me. I felt a sense of accomplishment and gratitude for all the
                    hard work and support that led me to this point. I was excited to celebrate with my family, friends, and
                    classmates, and to receive my diploma as a symbol of my academic success. I also felt a bit nervous and
                    curious about what the future would bring, but I was confident that I had the skills and knowledge to pursue
                    my goals.
